# Rupika — memory

## Criteria that worked well

- (website track) Yelp and YellowPages block direct fetches (403 on both,
  every time tried 2026-08-02) — don't bother fetching them directly.
  Instead: WebSearch scoped to `allowed_domains: ["facebook.com"]` for
  "[vertical] small business Facebook page [city]" surfaces real named
  businesses whose only presence is Facebook, which is exactly the
  website-track signal. Follow up with a plain named search
  ("[Business Name] [city] website") to confirm no domain turns up
  elsewhere (directories, reviews, etc.) before tagging it.
- Smaller/mid-size markets (tested: Enid OK, Bangor ME, Amarillo TX,
  Rapid City SD) turned up real no-website candidates faster than large
  metros would likely be — worth defaulting to smaller cities within the
  ICP verticals when picking a location for a run, even though the
  standing criteria is nationwide.
- A personal-looking email address (firstnamelastname@gmail/hotmail/etc.)
  is a real, usable signal for a likely owner name when nothing else
  turns one up — worth having Montague flag it as medium-confidence
  rather than skip it entirely. Worked for Chiliski's Painting
  (rosendovargas@hotmail.com -> likely "Rosendo").

- (package track) No website-gap filter needed, so this track can pull
  from bigger/more visible search results directly ("[vertical] company
  [city] family owned" / "locally owned") rather than needing the
  Facebook-only trick — those results reliably surface real SMB
  owner-operated shops (e.g. named-after-owner businesses, BBB profiles
  naming the owner) fast.
- (ads track, first run 2026-08-04) Yelp still blocks direct fetch
  (confirmed 403 again on a spot-check). `site:yelp.com [vertical]
  reviews` WebSearch surfaces individual business listing pages with
  review counts right in the search result title/snippet — usable as
  the "meaningful review count" signal. No "Sponsored" label showing in
  a listing's search-result title/snippet is the best available signal
  for "no visible ad activity" from search alone — genuinely can't
  confirm the sponsored badge without loading the live page, so this
  stays a Rupika-level guess same as the website track's convention;
  Montague needs a real way to check the live page during enrichment.
  Un-scoped `site:yelp.com` search results skewed toward big metros
  (NYC, Oakland, SF) rather than small markets — didn't scope by city
  this first run, worth trying a city-scoped version next time to see if
  it surfaces better SMB fits.
- `_template/brief.md` didn't have an "Ad activity status" field yet
  when the ads track was added 2026-08-04 — added it this run so future
  ads-track prospects have it by default.

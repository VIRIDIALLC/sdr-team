## Run notes

- **2026-08-05:** Drafted 6 prospects at `stage: enriched` → `drafted`:
  brezden-pest-control-san-luis-obispo-ca and restorion-bellevue-wa
  (`track: ads`, first real non-test drafts for this track — no prior
  example existed, leaned directly on `_ads-retainer-facts.md`'s proof
  points and the Yelp Partner Agency angle), iowa-greenscape-cedar-rapids-ia
  and kuberra-electric-duluth-mn (`track: website`, standard pitch),
  keith-hodge-plumbing-chattanooga-tn and schmidtlein-electric-topeka-ks
  (`track: package`, first real non-test drafts for this track too —
  neither had a Montague-verified response-time signal, so both fell
  back to the standard package pitch rather than the Yelp-advertiser
  hook).
- **Package-track pricing gap:** confirmed via `sage-quoting.md` that
  `track: package` has no fixed-tier price sheet in this repo (unlike
  `_pricing.md` for website). Standard package-track drafts should stay
  generic on tiers/pricing (lead-response/automation pain point + offer
  a conversation) rather than naming "Business Essentials" / "Never Miss
  a Lead" or inventing numbers — flag to Kevin each time until he says
  otherwise.
- **jc-heating-cooling-amarillo-tx skipped on purpose:** it's at
  `stage: enriched` but Kevin explicitly stepped it back there himself
  (2026-08-03) to hold it out of batch sends until its email gets phone-
  verified — the existing `outreach.md` draft is already done and
  untouched. Not a fresh enriched prospect needing a new draft; don't
  re-draft or re-advance this one until Kevin clears the email and moves
  it himself.
- No `no email found` skips this run (the defensive check in
  elly-outreach.md step 3) — everything picked up had a real email in
  `enrichment.md`.
- **2026-08-10:** Drafted 6 prospects at `stage: enriched` → `drafted`:
  aplus-garage-doors-idaho-falls-id and penas-landscaping-pocatello-id
  (`track: website`, no contact name found, plain "Hi," fallback),
  family-painting-services-cheyenne-wy (`track: website`, medium-confidence
  email-inferred name), johnston-heating-air-hot-springs-village-ar
  (`track: website`, confirmed name Steve Johnston — used the "only HVAC
  company inside the gated community" fact as the specific angle since it
  was an unusually strong, verified one), az-grand-roofing-painting-gilbert-az
  (`track: package`, **first real draft using the Yelp-advertiser
  response-time hook** — Montague directionally confirmed the signal even
  without an exact figure, so per elly-outreach.md step 4 this led with
  the hook and named Business Essentials / Never Miss a Lead by name,
  without inventing prices), exterior-specialists-pasadena-ca
  (`track: package`, response-time signal genuinely inconclusive per
  Montague, standard fallback pitch to confirmed owner Chris Jones).
  jc-heating-cooling-amarillo-tx again skipped on purpose — still held by
  Kevin pending phone-verification of its email, unchanged since
  2026-08-03.
- **Package-track hook vs. fallback, now has a real precedent both ways:**
  az-grand-roofing (hook used, signal directionally confirmed) and
  exterior-specialists (fallback, signal genuinely inconclusive) landed in
  the same run — useful side-by-side reference for how much confirmation
  is "enough" to lead with the hook: an imprecise-but-consistent figure
  (hours-to-a-day from one review) qualified, four conflicting numbers
  did not.

- **CORRECTION 2026-08-11 (Kevin):** the "Business Essentials" / "Never Miss a
  Lead" package names above are RETIRED — do NOT use them. Current offer is
  **The Complete System** ($1,197/mo all-in-one), per `_offer.md` and the
  website. Ads + websites are separate add-ons. Earlier log entries naming the
  old packages are historical only.

- **2026-08-11 (this run):** Fire payload asked me to draft for prospects
  enriched from Kevin's 273 hand-picked Yelp batch
  (`prospects/_kevin-yelp-handpicked/`) — checked, and that batch is still
  just the README + CSV (commit 61481b5). Montague hasn't built any
  individual prospect folders from it yet, so there was nothing from that
  specific batch to draft this run. Did my standing job instead: scanned
  all `prospects/*/status.md` for `stage: enriched` per elly-outreach.md
  step 2, found 2 real ones (unrelated to the CSV batch — both from
  Rupika's separate 2026-08-10 Phoenix/L.A. Yelp-advertisers hunt) and
  drafted both, first drafts written using **The Complete System** naming
  throughout (post-retirement correction):
  - **boldt-hvac-repair-glendale-az** (`track: package`) — response-time
    hook used, Montague verified 3 hr / 100% response rate, a real confirm
    among the recent run of inconclusive figures. Also carried forward
    Montague's AZROC license flag into the outreach note for Kevin's
    visibility (not a gate, just worth knowing before this goes further).
  - **rafael-iris-roofing-valley-village-ca** (`track: package`) —
    response-time signal contradictory (4th instance of that known
    instability), fell back to the standard package pitch per convention.
  - **jc-heating-cooling-amarillo-tx** skipped again, still held by Kevin
    pending phone-verification of its email, unchanged since 2026-08-03.
  - **Next run:** once Montague actually starts working the
    `_kevin-yelp-handpicked` CSV and prospect folders start appearing at
    `stage: enriched`, draft those per the fire payload's instruction —
    lead with the response-time/missed-lead pain, Purchase-Likelihood 4-5
    ones will be the highest priority per the CSV's own batching note.
